						<p class="text-color-6 font-size-110">Mustache Boii was created a few years back. It was a sketch given by someone special and was later developed by the artist as his own character.</p>
						<p class="text-color-6 font-size-110">The character Mustache Boii is the artist himself, a long-haired guy with a nevus in his lower left eye and of course, the legendary mustache.</p>
						<p class="text-color-6 font-size-110">With the idea of becoming whoever we want to be, he started creating different mustaches unique to each other, from colors to mood to concept.</p>
						<p class="text-color-6 font-size-110 mb-4 pb-2">It's a never-ending creative collaboration between the artist, what he sees, what he thinks, and what he feels.</p>
